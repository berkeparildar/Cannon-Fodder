## Introduction

“Cannon fodder” is a term used for soldiers who are expendable in war. There is also a game
with the same name from 1993, published by Sensible Software. This game has no relation to
its story or its gameplay.
Cannon Fodder is made up of several components that interact with each other. There are no
graphics required. You are welcome to add graphics if you choose to, however, you will be
graded by your knowledge and application of object oriented programming skills, not by any
artistic visualization of the game. Use your time wisely.
Cannon Fodder is about destroying as many enemy soldiers as possible using three characters
in a series of randomly generated levels. These three characters are Tank, Healer, and Fighter.
The enemy soldiers are regular characters. The levels will start from 0. For each level n, there
will be 2n enemies.
The game is turn-based. First you give orders to your characters, once they are done, the enemy
soldiers (the cannon fodder) take their turn.
